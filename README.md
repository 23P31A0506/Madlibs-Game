# 🐵 Mad Libs Game 📝

A simple and fun **Mad Libs** word game built using Python!  
Users are prompted to enter random words (like adjectives, nouns, and verbs), which are then used to generate a short, silly story.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

This game asks the player for:
- 3 **adjectives**
- 1 **noun**
- 1 **verb** (ending in "ing")

Then it plugs the words into a preset story template and prints the final story.
